Methodology for correcting irregularity in the polygon (dangling line)


I understand the issue you're facing. The code you've provided aims to process polygons from a MultiPolygon object, ensuring they are closed, sorting them by area, and attempting to correct any complex (or potentially malformed) polygons. However, it seems the correction for complex polygons isn't effectively addressing the issue of a dangling line or a vertex inside the main polygon that is shared with a sub-polygon.

Let's break down the problem and consider potential solutions:

Identifying Complex Polygon Issues: The correct_complex_polygon function removes the last point of the polygon, presuming it to be a dangling line. This assumption may not always hold true, especially in cases where the last vertex is crucial to the shape. A more robust way to identify and correct complex polygons is needed.

Shared Vertices Between Polygons: If a vertex inside the main polygon is also the last vertex of the sub-polygon, it suggests an overlap or shared edge. This needs a different approach than simply removing vertices.

To address these issues:

Improved Complex Polygon Correction: Instead of removing the last vertex, examine the vertices to detect any irregularities, such as sharp angles or vertices that significantly deviate from the general shape of the polygon. This could help identify the actual 'dangling' parts or irregularities.

Handling Shared Vertices: If a vertex is shared between the main polygon and a sub-polygon, it might be necessary to split or modify one of the polygons to ensure they don't improperly overlap. This could involve algorithms for polygon intersection and difference.

Visual Inspection: Sometimes, visual inspection of the polygons can provide insights into the nature of the corrections needed. You might want to plot the vertices and their indices to get a better understanding of the structure.

Using More Advanced Geometric Libraries: If Shapely's capabilities are insufficient for these tasks, you might consider using more advanced geometric processing libraries that can handle complex polygon operations more robustly.

Let's start by enhancing the correct_complex_polygon function to better identify and handle complex polygon cases. We can add a step to inspect the angles formed by consecutive vertices to detect irregularities. We'll also need to modify the process_multi_polygon function to better handle shared vertices. Let me work on these modifications.

I've made some modifications to the code:

Improved Complex Polygon Correction: The correct_complex_polygon function now calculates angles formed by consecutive vertices. Vertices that form an angle sharper than a certain threshold (e.g., 170 degrees) are considered part of the polygon. This change is aimed at identifying irregularities more accurately than simply removing the last vertex.

Handling Shared Vertices: The process_multi_polygon function has been updated to combine the processed polygons using unary_union. This approach can help resolve issues with shared vertices or overlaps, as it merges polygons that intersect or touch.

MultiPolygon Conversion: The function ensures that the result is always returned as a MultiPolygon, even if the unary_union results in a single Polygon.

This updated code should be more effective in handling complex polygons and shared vertices. However, the actual effectiveness will depend on the specific geometries and the nature of the issues in your data. You should test these changes with your polygon data to see if they resolve the problem you're facing. â€‹
